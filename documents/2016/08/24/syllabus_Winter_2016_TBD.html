<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Summary of the course</h1>
<p>A course on computer systems topics, focusing on operating systems components and their relevance for application programming. Caching, memory hierarchy, performance optimization, linking, processes, virtual memory, dynamic memory allocation, system level I/O.</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Textbooks and printed resources</h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 2nd Edition</span>, Bryant & O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall/Pearson, 2011, ISBN: 978-0136108047.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The C Programming Language, 2nd edition</span>, Kernighan & Ritchie, Prentice Hall/Pearson, 1988, ISBN: 978-0131103627.</p>
<p>The primary textbook is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Computer Systems</span> book by Bryant & O'Hallaron; it is essential to the course. The lectures will cover the material in this book, and the homework assignments and tests will be drawn from it. The book on C programming, by Kernighan & Ritchie, is a useful resource for learning the basics, as well as some of the intricacies, of programming in the C language, but you may prefer other materials.</p>

<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Assignments and Grading</h1>
<p><i>Overview</i></p>
<p>This is a programming-intensive course. There will be three (3) lab assignments, two (2) homework assignments, a Midterm exam, and a Final exam. All of these assignments and tests require you to read and write code in the C programming language, as well as develop proficiency in systems concepts. The due dates for all assignments will be listed in the lecture notes and the assignments themselves, as well as added to this syllabus. Further details will be posted on the class website, which is on Desire2Learn (D2L).</p>
<p><i>Sec. 1. Lab Assignments</i></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Each lab assignment is designed to develop proficiency in performing system level tasks. You must complete each program individually.</li>
	<li>These labs will be graded on a server running a version of CentOS Linux. You will be provided with an account on the server, where you may write, compile, and execute code. You may also develop your programs on another platform, but, for purposes of grading, your code must compile, link, and execute on the official platform for this class. <b>Programs that fail to compile, link, or execute do not pass.</b></li>
	<li><span id="red_text">Late programming assignments will be accepted until the beginning of the class during which a solution is discussed.</span> After you submit your code, it will be reviewed and feedback will be provided on D2L. You may revise your code and resubmit it as often as you like up until the due date. Programs submitted after the due date will be graded, but you will not be given the opportunity to correct your mistakes. If you wish to correct your code before a final grade is given, you must do so by the due date. Your grade will be the highest score that you receive for all of the versions that are graded.</li>
	<li>Although Lab 3 has two parts, due on different dates, each part will constitute a separate lab for purposes of grading.</li>
	<li>Each source file must begin with a comment block containing the following information:
<pre>
// Student Name:
// Lab/Homework #:
// Source file name:
</pre></li>
	</ul>
<p><i>Sec. 2. Homework Assignments</i></p>
<ul>
<li>There will be two short homework assignments, consisting of problems from the primary textbook.</li>
<li>You must complete these assignments individually; however, you may discuss the problems with your classmates.</li>
<li>If a homework problem requires some code as the answer, your solution need not compile, link, or execute. Code in homework assignments is graded on concepts.</li>
<li>With regard to homeworks assignments, however, the grading of a submission may well indicate or strongly suggest the correct answer and, therefore, resubmission may not be permitted. Furthermore, if there is insufficient time to review the answers in class prior to an exam, I may provide information about the correct answer in the grading.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Sec. 3. Midterm Exam</i></p>
	<ul>
	<li>The exam will consist of questions drawn from the textbook, the lectures, the first lab, and the homework assignments.</li>
	</ul>
<p><i>Sec. 4. Final Exam</i></p>
	<ul>
	<li>The Final exam is comprehensive; therefore, it will consist of questions drawn from the textbook, the lectures, all three labs, and the homework assignments.</li>
	</ul>
<p><i>How Your Grade for the Course Is Calculated</i></p>
<p>The various assignments and tests comprise the following percentages of your final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>40%&nbsp;&nbsp;Labs (split evenly between them)</li>
<li>10%&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeworks (split evenly between them)</li>
<li>25%&nbsp;&nbsp;Midterm exam</li>
<li>25%&nbsp;&nbsp;Final exam</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Alternative grade procedure for Midterm and Final exams</b>: If you have a documented disability, such as a history of extreme test taking anxiety, please see me for accommodation.</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Policy on Working Together</h1>
<p>Each student is expected to turn in original code for the programming assignments. Copying code from another person is considered a serious violation of the university's academic integrity policy (see below).</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Course Schedule</h1>
<p>TBD</p>
<p>The schedule of topics will be determined later and posted on the class website, which is on Desire2Learn (D2L).</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Attendance</h1>
<p>Although attendance is encouraged in order to foster participation, it is not mandatory.</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</h1>
<p>This course will be subject to the university's academic integrity policy. More information can be found at <a href="http://academicintegrity.depaul.edu/">http://academicintegrity.depaul.edu/</a>. If you have any questions be sure to consult with your professor.</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Academic Policies</h1>
<p>All students are required to manage their class schedules each term in accordance with the deadlines for enrolling and withdrawing as indicated in the University Academic Calendar. Information on enrollment, withdrawal, grading and incompletes can be found at: <a href="http://cdm.depaul.edu/enrollment">http://cdm.depaul.edu/enrollment.</a></p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Students with Disabilities</h1>
<p>Students who feel they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the instructor privately to discuss their specific needs. All discussions will remain confidential. To ensure that you receive the most appropriate accommodation based on your needs, contact the instructor as early as possible in the quarter (preferably within the first week of class), and make sure that you have contacted the Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) at: csd@depaul.edu.<br /> Lewis Center 1420, 25 East Jackson Blvd. <br /> Phone number: (312)362-8002<br /> Fax: (312)362-6544 <br /> TTY: (773)325.7296</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Online Course Evaluations</h1>
<p>Evaluations are a way for students to provide valuable feedback regarding their instructor and the course. Detailed feedback will enable the instructor to continuously tailor teaching methods and course content to meet the learning goals of the course and the academic needs of the students. They are a requirement of the course and are key to continue to provide you with the highest quality of teaching. The evaluations are anonymous; the instructor and administration do not track who entered what responses. A program is used to check if the student completed the evaluations, but the evaluation is completely separate from the student&rsquo;s identity. Since 100% participation is our goal, students are sent periodic reminders over three weeks. Students do not receive reminders once they complete the evaluation. Students complete the evaluation online in <a href="https://campusconnect.depaul.edu">CampusConnect</a>.</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">Changes to Syllabus</h1>
<p>This syllabus is subject to change as necessary during the quarter. If a change occurs, it will be thoroughly addressed during class, posted under Announcements in D2L and sent via email.</p>
<h1 class="dashed_gray_box">School Policies</h1>
<p>Policies of the school are explained on the webpage for this course on my.cdm.depaul.edu.</p>
